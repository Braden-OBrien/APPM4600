O'Brien

These are all of the files for Braden O'Brien's APPM 4600 submissions.

Immediately, see the /Homework/HomeworkX folders for the various homework files and submissions, and /Labs/LabX for the various lab files and submissions.

Included in these folders may be various .py programs and .png images saved from matplotlib-pyplot. This is due to the programming being done on WSL on windows, so the plots need to be opened in the Windows graphics engine locally.

These changes will be regularly pushed to GitHub to keep up to date on the Homeworks and Labs we're doing.
